- 👋 Hi, I’m Francisco, and I am in my last semester of Baruch studying Information Security and Risk Management
- 👀 I have two prior work experience in IT. My first experience came from working at a NYC public school as a DOE Technology Support intern, during my three years there I help maintain the school’s computer inventory, and assisted staff with any technology issue that came up. I also got to work on some amazing project, one being a Host monitoring tool that I created using python to help ping all the printers in the school and display weather the device was connected to the network or not. I also helped development an interactive inventory system using google sheets formulas. My second experience came from working as a security, privacy and Risk consultant this summer. At RSM I assisted in doing due diligence, risk analysis, and helped write out HITRUST policy to different clients. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project
- 📫 How to reach me ...
